## ⚠️ Important Safety Reminders
1. **Always Dump Your NAND/NOR/Flash** before any major modification.
2. **Verify MD5 Hashes** of every system firmware (PUP, BIN, etc.).
3. **Avoid System Updates (OFW)** unless the guide explicitly states it's safe.
4. **Thermal Watch:** Keep an eye on temperatures post-modding.
